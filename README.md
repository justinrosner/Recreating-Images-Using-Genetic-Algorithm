This was the final project for Software Engineering 2S03 at McMaster University.  In this project we were asked to create and implement a genetic algorithm that would take a randomly generated ppm image and reconstruct it into the given image.



The pictures below illustrate the process from random pixels, to final image.

The above image is the before picture, and the bottom is after the genetic algorithm was applied.
